                <p> “Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to 
                    find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity",
                     John Muir. Travel and holidays this summer will be radically different from what we
                      have done in the last years. Most travelers will likely choose to stay closer to home
                       and may adopt a more cautious approach to travel, looking for safe destinations.
                        Proximity and moving within a socio-culturally similar geographical space can be
                         decisive elements in increasing the sense of security for these guests. What will
                    be the main reason to travel next summer? To reconnect with nature.
                    Three months of quarantine have left physical and psychological traces in all of us,
                     and exercise, returning to nature, and <span id="dots">...</span><span id="invisible-text">stimulating the senses will be the best remedy
                      to truly return to normal. After the lockdown, it is advisable to dedicate the 
                      summer to a sports activity of less intensity, but a lot of mobility and with a 
                      longer duration like walking or hiking: an outdoor low-impact activity that makes
                       us able to enjoy what has been desired and could not be done during the 
                       quarantine, and as far as possible, accompanied by others.

                    <p1>
                    Call me crazy or cliche or what ever..but there is no denying it. Maybe it’s
                     that dose of fresh mountain air, the exercise or the litres of water I drink
                      when I’m hiking, but I swear to you that after a visit to the mountains I
                       feel enormously better. It’s as if there is an energy source in those summits
                        that you can tap into and feed off of. Getting out there literally fuels you
                         and rebalances you; you will notably feel more calm and happy, and less
                          irritable or anxious. There was never a time that I left the mountains
                           without feeling refreshed, happy and inspired – ready to take on 
                           anything that came my way.
